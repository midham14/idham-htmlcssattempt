            <p>So, this is me. My name is Mohammad Idham, I'am 24 Years old. I Graduated from Bina Nusantara University, and right now <br>
                I studying at <span style="color: orange;">Hacktiv8</span> . I take a Fullstack Javascript course at <span style="color: orange;">Hacktiv8</span> 
                and so far so fun, its really fun to learn Javascript lol idk why, but i think because i really like mystery things maybe ? I really like to solve the
                problem even sometimes it takes so much time but its really worth to try lol.<br>
                 Yep i still at phase 0 and hopefully can move on to phase 1. so far i learn a lot of things here, like <em>Algorithm</em>, <em>Pseudocode</em>,<em>Conditional</em>, <em>Looping</em>, <em>Function</em><br>
                <br>
                I want to talk about my hobby, fav singer, fav game, etc now hehe :)
